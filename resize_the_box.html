    1. Which CSS unit would you use for a responsive layout and why?
        I would use vw and vh as they respond to the device screen for the main elements in the page. Going down the
        DOM I would use % for the children elements.

        I can use REM for making sure that the text increases if 
        the root measure increases (if a user has made their browser set to bigger character it will scale accordingly in their case, making it accessible).
    
    2. How do em and rem units differ when changing parent or root font size?
        Rem is more consistent as it relates to root level of 
        the DOM, whilst em is more volatile as it depends to
        the its parent size but it is useful for reusability of
        components in the website. Em is more design friendly
        whilst rem is more accessible friendly as it changes with
        each user experience browser root settings

    3. What happens to elements using vw and vh when you resize the browser window?
        The content adapts to the viewport size, even the text 
        scales up and down (cannot use it if it's inline dislpay
        but in this case the text is inside a div block element).
        If I set a width for the .container that is smaller than
        viewport width so that the block element div.container
        does not fill the full width, then the .vwvh-box can 
        extend past the .container itself, so it doesn't consider
        its parent element size.
    
    4.  Why might fixed pixel units be less ideal for mobile design?
        If the set px are too large for smaller mobile screens
        it can change the whole layout of the page and the user
        would have to scroll to view something that doesn't take
        much space on a pc.
        If the user has settings for text size, it won't respect it.
        Use vh,vw, rem when starting a page and em for child elements, this will avoid text or elements become blurry
        on screens with less pixels resolutions like 360px screens.
        Text in pixels could also break out of a div parent in
        small screens.

    5.  In your own words, explain when you would use each of the following units: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh.
        Pixels: I would use them with elements that don't need
            scaling. If I have small borders or icons, for precision.
            Also images need to be in px or they can get blurry
            and lose their definition. 
        Rem: I would use it for anything that needs scaling 
        typography included. Right after the root size has been 
        set I would use rem for the main elements of the DOM, 
        especially typography.
        Em: I would use em for components that are descendant or
        children of another where I need to build consistency and
        reusability of the whole block across the web application. Typography for small UI components like
        buttons.
        %: I would use it as I need to adapt an element inside a
        container but I need symmetry to matter with its parent
        element.
        vw/vh: I would use it to build consistency across multiple devices, for exaple for defining the body of the page and have the content within a certain margin 
        from the edge of the screen. It would be used for large
        components that are at the top of the DOM in this instance.
